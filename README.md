# TE and WR NFL Combine Data Analysis 

Analyzing the relationship between combine performance and career stats for TEs and WRs.

## Dataset
First, I scraped [NFL Draft Data](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2020/draft.htm) for career stats and [NFL Combine Data](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/2020-combine.htm) for combine performance stats from 2000 to 2020. Then I merged the two datasets using an inner merge to focus on players who were drafted and performed in the combine. 

## Results

## Next Steps
Expanding my analysis to players who were drafted but did not perform in the combine and vice versa. Adding more career performance stats like receiving yards per reception.
